# Neural Networks From Scratch in Python
This repository contains the source code I wrote when following the book called "*Neural Networks From Scratch in Python*" [1]. The idea behind this book is to teach how Neural Networks work and how to build one from scratch, i.e., without using any machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. I decided to read and follow this book to improve my understanding of NNs and also to gain more knowledge about how to build them.

Most probably I will take some months to be able to finish this project due to other activities, so have this in mind if you ran into my repository and you found it empty or half way done. Also, all source code is licensed under the MIT License. No contents of the book are in this repository with the exception of Python Code/Software.
